# html-snakeGame
A **single-file** snake game (SNEK SOULS) made purely in html and vanilla JavaScript, with both keyboard and touchscreen functionality.

All you need is **snakeGame.html**, you can either upload it to your server or run it locally.
You can change the *Editable Variables* to your liking, before deploying/running it.

Have fun! :D
